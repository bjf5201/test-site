        <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
        
        <p>Born and raised in central North Carolina, I have loved tinkering with computers for as long as I can remember. I created my first website at the age of eleven, which was a fansite dedicated to Hilary Duff called "Hilary Heaven.com". I taught myself front end development languages through a process of trial, error, and a lot of Googling. Stack Overflow and Reddit became my best friends. After about a year I had taught myself HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>

        I took some time off from web development to pursue another passion of mine, acting, for seven years. While I was away from the world of the web, I still found myself creating graphics and websites every now and then to promote various shows I was a part of and I worked on some websites for my fellow acting friends and myself. 

        <p>About a year ago I dusted off my keyboard and threw myself back into web development. I also began educating myself on network administration. I wanted to become knowledgable on all aspects of how a business utlizes information technology. I was given the opportunity to intern for ProCTS, a professional IT consulting firm here in Wilmington, NC. I assisted them in setting up new user accounts on various devices and installing software on brand new machines.</p>

        <p>In the last year I've become much more proficient in my web development skills as well. I've learned Git and the the BASH command line. I know Sass and use that to write all my CSS now. Additionally, I've learned CSS Grid/Flexbox and use that to make responsive, clean layouts. To speed up the writing of my HTML, I use JavaScript templating to write all my content.</p>

        <p>I am eager to learn even more. What excites me about IT is that you simply never stop learning. THe knoweledge base grows exponentially with each day. I am seeking an internship for the Fall of 2021 where I am get to learn at such a pace. I believe I would bring the proper technical skills and determination required for any entry-level IT role in an organization.</p>
